# Welcome to the jsPsych in Qualtrics Tutorial Series

<font color=red>**WARNING!! This tutorial series is based on version `6.x` of jsPsych. Due to extensive changes in jsPsych 7.x and above, many things in this tutorial won't work. However, you can still download [jsPsych v6.3.1 (the last jsPsych 6.x release)](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases/download/v6.3.1/jspsych-6.3.1.zip) and use it for your projects.**</font>

Hello, I am [Kyoung Whan](https://kywch.github.io) and have used jsPsych within Qualtrics extensively in my research. 
For example, I developed the [Choose-And-Solve Task](https://kywch.github.io/CAST_jsPsych/) with jsPsych, 
ran the task using Qualtrics with math attitude surveys, and published a paper, 
titled **"Calculated avoidance: Math anxiety predicts math avoidance in effort-based decision-making"** 
[(Choe et al., 2019, *Science Advances*)](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/11/eaay1062).

The purpose of this tutorial series is to provide an easy-to-follow guide to Qualtrics users (e.g., many social and psychological science researchers) on embedding jsPsych-based behavioral experiments into Qualtrics so that they could study interesting individual differences, correlating questionnaires vs. behavioral/cognitive measures. 

This tutorial assumes that readers are familiar with Qualtrics and have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub.
For the beginners, I try to find and link good external resources (like below), so **please do not give up and give it a try**.

If you are looking for Qualtrics tutorials, there are other excellent tutorials available, as well as Qualtrics' official support page. For example,

* [CSULB Qualtrics Guide](https://csulb.libguides.com/qualtrics/)

If you are looking for jsPsych v6.x tutorial, the best place to start is [the jsPsych v6.3 Hello World! tutorial](https://www.jspsych.org/6.3/tutorials/hello-world/). Also please check out these resources:
