# Welcome to the jsPsych in Qualtrics Tutorial Series

Hello, I am [Kyoung Whan](https://kywch.github.io) and have been actively using jsPsych and Qualtrics in my research. 
For example, I developed the [Choose-And-Solve Task](https://kywch.github.io/CAST_jsPsych/) with jsPsych and 
published a paper, titled **"Calculated avoidance: Math anxiety predicts math avoidance in effort-based decision-making"**
[(Choe et al., 2019, *Science Advances*)](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/11/eaay1062).

I am putting together this tutorial series to provide an easy-to-follow guide for using jsPsych with Qualtrics. 
I also aim to compile many working examples so that you can easily embed cognitive tasks into your study. 
So, if you have suggestions, **please shoot me an email to  `choe_DOT_kyoung` at `gmail_DOT_com`**, so that I can priotize the tasks.

This tutorial assumes that readers are familiar with Qualtrics and have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub.
For the beginners, I try to find and link good external resources (like below), so **please do not give up and give it a try**.

If you are looking for Qualtrics tutorials, there are other excellent tutorials available, as well as Qualtrics' official support page. For example,

* [CSULB Qualtrics Guide](https://csulb.libguides.com/qualtrics/)
* [UNTHSC Qualtrics User Guide](https://www.unthsc.edu/center-for-innovative-learning/qualtrics-user-guide/)

If you are looking for jsPsych tutorial, the best place to start is [the jsPsych Hello World! tutorial](https://www.jspsych.org/tutorials/hello-world/). You should also look at [the YouTube tutorial from Josh de Leeuw](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnfo1lBY1P2Mf_o6rV5wiqqn92Mw3UTGh).
